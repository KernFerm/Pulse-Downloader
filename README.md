## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why does my download fail?**
A: The URL may be invalid, the server may not support direct downloads, or you may not have permission. Try using yt-dlp fallback.

**Q: How do I resume a download?**
A: If the file already exists, the downloader will attempt to resume using HTTP Range headers (if supported by the server).

**Q: How do I install yt-dlp?**
A: Run `pip install yt-dlp` in your terminal.

**Q: The GUI won't start!**
A: Make sure you have PyQt5 installed: `pip install PyQt5`.

**Q: Can I use this on macOS or Linux?**
A: Yes, but system tray features are Windows-only.
